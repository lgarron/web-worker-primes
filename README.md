# Web Worker Example

This is a simple demonstration of how to use web workers, in order to compute the number of primes below a given number (without freezing the page).

This was put together by Lucas Garron for an [ACM Lightning Tech Talk](http://stanfordacm.com/) on Jan. 27, 2012 (slides [here](http://code.garron.us/talks/web-workers/)).
